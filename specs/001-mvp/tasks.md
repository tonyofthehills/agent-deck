# Tasks: Agent Deck MVP (Phases 0-2)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mvp/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), data-model.md, contracts/websocket-protocol.md

**Tests**: Manual testing only in Phase 1-2 (per constitution). No automated test tasks generated.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Project structure (monorepo):
- **Root**: pnpm workspace with apps/ and packages/

1. OutputParser (T094-T097) - can run in parallel
2. Integration with AgentInstance (T098-T100) - depends on OutputParser
3. React Native display (T101-T103) - depends on WebSocket integration

**User Story 5** (Zero Config):
1. First-launch logic (T104-T110) - depends on ConfigManager
2. SettingsView (T111-T117) - can develop in parallel with first-launch

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Monorepo Setup Phase** (some can run in parallel):

- T001: Reorganize directories
- T002-T003: Create shared-types (sequential)
- T005: Update .gitignore (can run parallel with T002-T004)

**Within Setup Phase** (all can run in parallel):
- T010: Add Yams dependency
- T011: Create folder structure
- T012: Create Assets.xcassets

**Within Foundational Phase** (all models can run in parallel):
- T014-T017: All 4 model files (AgentInstance, AgentStatus, StatusUpdate, Configuration)

**Within User Story 1**:
- T024-T025: ProcessMonitor (developer A)
- T030-T031: WebSocketServer (developer B)
- T035-T036: MenuBarView (developer C)
- T037-T042: React Native UI (developer D)
- T043-T049: Basic parsing (developer E)

**Within React Native Polish Phase** (all can run in parallel):
- T089: Keep awake toggle
- T090: App icon/splash
- T091: Pull-to-refresh
- T092: Connection status header

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 + 3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 0: Monorepo Setup (T000-T006) - **CRITICAL: ~1.5 days**
2. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T007-T013)
3. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T014-T023) - CRITICAL blocking phase
4. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T024-T064)
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T065-T076)
6. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T077-T088)
7. Complete Phase 6: React Native Polish (T089-T093)
8. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test P1 stories independently (Day 13-14)
9. If passing: Proceed to Phase 9-10 (integration testing, deploy)
10. If failing: Fix critical issues, re-test

**Timeline**: Week 1 (Phases 0-3), Week 2 (Phases 4-6), Week 3 (Phases 9-10)

### Incremental Delivery

**Week 1 Milestone** (End of Day 7):
- Monorepo + Foundation + User Story 1 complete
- Can monitor Claude Code from Mac menubar
- Can see status updates on React Native app (if deployed)
- Demo: Mac app detecting agents, mobile showing real-time updates

**Week 2 Milestone** (End of Day 14):
- User Stories 2 + 3 + React Native polish complete
- Full MVP ready: monitoring + window switching + QR setup
- React Native app installable on iOS/Android
- Ready for Show HN launch

### Full Feature Set (Optional Post-MVP)

After MVP validation (Week 3+):
1. Add User Story 4 (parsed output) if users request context
2. Add User Story 5 (zero config) if installation friction reported
3. Iterate based on Show HN feedback

## Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (or agents):

**Week 1: After Monorepo + Foundational Complete**
- Developer A: ProcessMonitor (T024-T029)
- Developer B: WebSocketServer (T030-T034)
- Developer C: MenuBarView (T035-T036)
- Developer D: React Native app setup + AgentListScreen (T037-T042)
- Developer E: Basic parsing (T043-T049)

**Week 2: After US1 Complete**
- Developer A: WindowManager + AppleScript (T065-T069)
- Developer B: WebSocket focus handlers (T070-T073)
- Developer C: React Native tap handlers (T074-T076)
- Developer D: QR code generation (T077-T084)
- Developer E: QR scanner + navigation (T085-T088)

**Week 2 End: Polish & Integration**
- Developers A-E: React Native polish (T089-T093)
- All developers: Integration testing (T118-T141)
- Developer A: Documentation (T142-T143)
- Developer B: Deployment (T144-T150)

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies (safe for parallel execution)
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Manual testing only (per constitution: automated tests in Phase 3+)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **Phase 0 is CRITICAL**: Monorepo setup must complete before ANY other work
- **Shared types package** enables type safety between Mac app (Swift) and mobile app (TypeScript via WebSocket)
- **React Native over PWA**: Native mobile experience, better performance, offline capability, app store distribution

- **React Native specific tasks**: QR scanner, keep awake, pull-to-refresh, AsyncStorage
- **Deployment tasks**: Added Expo builds for iOS/Android (T146-T148)
- Rich data enhancement (T050-T064) completed as part of User Story 1 (P1 MVP)
